# Enhanced RAG System with Groq API Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you implement an enhanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system using the Groq API for better answer generation and improved prompt engineering.

## What's Enhanced

### üöÄ **Better Answer Generation**
- **Groq API Integration**: Uses Llama3-8b-8192 model for intelligent responses
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Optimized prompts for clear, accurate answers
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Better understanding of document content and questions

### üîç **Improved Context Validation**
- **Multi-Method Relevance Scoring**: Combines keyword matching, semantic similarity, and question type analysis
- **Lower Thresholds**: Better coverage of relevant questions
- **Smart Filtering**: Enhanced section relevance detection

### üí¨ **Enhanced Chat Experience**
- **Export Functionality**: Download chat history as JSON
- **Better Timestamps**: More accurate interaction tracking
- **System Status**: Real-time API connection status

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install groq PyPDF2
```

### 2. Set Environment Variable

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Or set it in your system:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### 3. Get Groq API Key

1. Visit [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key to your environment variable

## Key Features

### Enhanced RAGSystem Class

```python
class EnhancedRAGSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_document = None
        self.document_content = None
        self.document_hash = None
        self.chat_history = []
        self.groq_client = None
        self._initialize_groq()
```

### Advanced Prompt Engineering

```python
def _create_advanced_prompt(self, question: str, document_content: str) -> str:
    prompt = """You are an expert document analysis assistant. Your task is to provide clear, accurate, and comprehensive answers based on the provided document content.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Answer ONLY based on the information provided in the document
2. If the document doesn't contain enough information, clearly state this
3. Provide specific examples and quotes from the document when possible
4. Structure your answer logically with clear sections
5. Use bullet points for lists and key information
6. Be concise but thorough
7. If the question is ambiguous, ask for clarification
8. Always cite the source as "Based on the document content"

ANSWER FORMAT:
- Start with a direct answer to the question
- Provide supporting details from the document
- Include relevant examples or quotes
- Summarize key points
- End with "Source: Uploaded PDF document"

Remember: Accuracy and relevance are more important than length."""
    
    return prompt
```

### Multi-Method Relevance Scoring

```python
def _calculate_enhanced_relevance(self, question: str, document_content: str) -> float:
    # Method 1: Keyword matching
    question_keywords = self._extract_keywords(question)
    document_keywords = self._extract_keywords(document_content)
    keyword_score = self._calculate_keyword_relevance(question_keywords, document_keywords)
    
    # Method 2: Semantic similarity
    semantic_score = self._calculate_semantic_similarity(question, document_content)
    
    # Method 3: Question type analysis
    question_type_score = self._analyze_question_type(question, document_content)
    
    # Combine scores with weights
    final_score = (keyword_score * 0.4 + semantic_score * 0.4 + question_type_score * 0.2)
    
    return min(final_score, 1.0)
```

### Groq API Integration

```python
def _generate_groq_answer(self, question: str, document_content: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Create advanced prompt
        prompt = self._create_advanced_prompt(question, document_content)
        
        # Get relevant context
        relevant_context = self._get_relevant_context(question, document_content)
        
        # Prepare messages for Groq
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": prompt
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Question: {question}\n\nDocument Context:\n{relevant_context}"
            }
        ]
        
        # Call Groq API
        response = self.groq_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="llama3-8b-8192",  # Fast and efficient model
            messages=messages,
            temperature=0.3,  # Lower temperature for more focused answers
            max_tokens=1000,
            top_p=0.9
        )
        
        answer = response.choices[0].message.content
        
        # Post-process answer
        answer = self._post_process_answer(answer)
        
        return answer
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Groq API: {e}")
        return self._generate_fallback_answer(question, document_content)
```

## Benefits

### üéØ **Better Answer Quality**
- More accurate and relevant responses
- Better understanding of context
- Structured and organized answers

### üîç **Improved Context Detection**
- Lower false negatives for relevant questions
- Better coverage of document content
- Smarter relevance scoring

### üöÄ **Performance Improvements**
- Faster response generation with Groq API
- Better text preprocessing
- Enhanced error handling

### üí° **User Experience**
- Clear feedback on API status
- Export functionality for chat history
- Better question suggestions for out-of-context queries

## Fallback System

When Groq API is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to enhanced algorithms:

- Improved keyword extraction
- Better semantic similarity calculation
- Enhanced section relevance detection
- Structured answer generation

## Testing

Test the enhanced system with:

```python
# Test enhanced RAG system
rag = EnhancedRAGSystem()

# Check API status
status = rag.get_system_status()
print(f"Groq API Available: {status['groq_available']}")

# Process PDF and ask questions
# The system will automatically use Groq API if available
# or fall back to enhanced algorithms if not
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**
   - Ensure GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is set
   - Check for typos in the key
   - Restart your application after setting the variable

2. **Import Errors**
   - Install groq library: `pip install groq`
   - Check Python path configuration

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - Groq has generous free tier limits
   - Monitor usage in console.groq.com
   - Implement rate limiting if needed

### Performance Tips

1. **Context Length**: Limit document context to 3000 characters for optimal API performance
2. **Temperature**: Use 0.3 for focused, accurate answers
3. **Max Tokens**: 1000 tokens provide good answer length without excessive cost

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the EnhancedRAGSystem class** in your main.py
2. **Set up your Groq API key**
3. **Test with sample PDFs**
4. **Monitor answer quality improvements**
5. **Customize prompts for your specific use case**

The enhanced RAG system will provide significantly better answers and a more intelligent question-answering experience!
