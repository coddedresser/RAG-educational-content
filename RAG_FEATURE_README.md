# RAG Document Q&A Feature

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Document Q&A feature has been successfully implemented in the main application. This feature allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content, with intelligent context validation and answer generation.

## Features

### üìÑ **Single PDF Per Chat**
- Users can upload one PDF document at a time
- Each document creates a unique chat session
- New chat sessions can be started to upload different documents

### ü§ñ **Smart Question Answering**
- Questions are analyzed for relevance to the uploaded document
- Answers are generated based on document content
- Context-aware responses with relevant information extraction

### üîç **Context Validation**
- Automatic detection of out-of-context questions
- Relevance scoring system (0.0 to 1.0)
- Clear feedback when questions don't relate to the document

### üí¨ **Chat History**
- Complete conversation tracking
- Timestamped Q&A pairs
- Relevance scores for each interaction
- Expandable chat history view

## Technical Implementation

### RAGSystem Class

The core RAG functionality is implemented in the `RAGSystem` class with the following key methods:

#### `process_pdf(pdf_file)`
- Extracts text content from uploaded PDF files
- Generates document hash for identification
- Stores document metadata (filename, pages, size)
- Clears previous chat history

#### `ask_question(question)`
- Validates question relevance to current document
- Generates context-aware answers
- Stores interactions in chat history
- Returns relevance scores and context status

#### `start_new_chat()`
- Clears current document and chat history
- Allows uploading new PDF documents
- Maintains single PDF per chat rule

### Key Components

1. **PDF Processing**: Uses PyPDF2 for text extraction
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Filters stop words and extracts meaningful terms
3. **Relevance Calculation**: Keyword matching algorithm for context validation
4. **Answer Generation**: Content-based response creation
5. **Session Management**: Streamlit session state integration

## User Experience

### Document Upload
1. User selects a PDF file using the file uploader
2. Clicks "Process PDF" to extract content
3. System displays document information (pages, size)
4. Chat interface becomes available

### Question Asking
1. User types questions in the text input field
2. System analyzes question relevance to document
3. Generates appropriate response or indicates out-of-context
4. Shows relevance score for transparency

### Chat Management
1. All Q&A interactions are stored in chat history
2. Users can expand chat entries to see full details
3. "Start New Chat" button clears current session
4. New PDF uploads automatically start fresh conversations

## Context Validation Logic

### Relevance Threshold
- **In Context**: Relevance score ‚â• 0.3
- **Out of Context**: Relevance score < 0.3

### Keyword Matching
- Extracts keywords from questions and document content
- Filters common stop words and short terms
- Calculates match percentage for relevance scoring

### Smart Filtering
- Considers substantial paragraphs (>50 characters)
- Applies lower threshold (0.2) for section relevance
- Limits relevant sections to top 3 for concise answers

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies
- **PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction and processing
- **hashlib**: Document hash generation for identification

### Existing Dependencies
- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and timestamp handling
- **typing**: Type hints for better code quality

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   python test_rag.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```python
# Initialize RAG system
rag = RAGSystem()

# Upload and process PDF
result = rag.process_pdf(pdf_file)
if result['success']:
    print(f"PDF loaded: {result['document_info']['filename']}")

# Ask questions
answer = rag.ask_question("What are the main topics?")
print(f"Answer: {answer['answer']}")
print(f"Relevance: {answer['relevance_score']:.2f}")

# Start new chat
rag.start_new_chat()
```

### Context Validation
```python
# In-context question
result = rag.ask_question("What does the document say about AI?")
if result['context'] == 'in_context':
    print("Question is relevant to document")
else:
    print("Question is out of context")

# Out-of-context question
result = rag.ask_question("What's the weather like today?")
if result['context'] == 'out_of_context':
    print("Question not related to document content")
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test script to verify RAG functionality:
```bash
python test_rag.py
```

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ RAG system initialization
- ‚úÖ Document state management
- ‚úÖ Chat history tracking
- ‚úÖ New chat session creation
- ‚úÖ Question validation without document
- ‚úÖ Keyword extraction
- ‚úÖ Relevance calculation
- ‚úÖ Context validation logic

## Security Features

### Document Isolation
